Survey Area
	Given a polygonal survey area for the drone to traverse and a set obstacles with known positions and radius (obstacles are circles), generate a traversal path of the survey area without running into obstacles).

Algorithm:
	- Identify BEGIN, END, IN, OUT, and MIDDLE events and sort them
		according to their x-coordinates.
	- Instantiate polygonal obstacles and survey area
	- iterate through events (event line scanning from left to right):
		- BEGIN event: create a new cell
		- END event: end all cells that is still opened
		- IN event: 
			terminate the cell in contact with the event line
			(old cell) and start two or more new cells that 
			the old cell is split into.
			
		- OUT event:
			terminate the cells in contact with the event line
			(old cells) and start a new cell that the old cells
			are combined into.

		- MIDDLE event:
			update the cell that is in contact with the event line.
			Enqueue the new edge as the floor or roof edge of the
			cell, which has the edge prior to the event as floor 
			or root.

		- Close Cells and start new ones:
			Check open cells to see if their ceiling and floor edges
			match any of the edges that the events' scanlines have
			intersected. If so, the cell is affected and terminated.
			New cells are opened.

			*Check for duplicates:
			When opening new cells, check if the starting ceiling and
			floor edges of any two are the same. If so, they are duplicates
			and one should be removed.
Classes:
	- Event:
		BEGIN event: store next roof and floor edges following the event
		END event: no need to store edges
		IN event: store 
		OUT event: store widest possible pair of edges after the event so
			that we close all cells that have pairs of roof and floor
			edges within them.

		MIDDLE event:
		Middle event can be further classified to CEILING and FLOOR events


	* END event can be impl. as a special type of IN event. (and BEGIN as OUT) 
	* events could be edges or points

	- Polygon : polygon_2d
		Interfaces:
		1. Given an event location, check if the polygon has an intersection
		with the scan line at the event location. If so, return the edges
		of the polygon that intersect with the scan line.

		Members:
			- Edges : segment_2d
				Each edge inherits from 
			- Vertices : point_2d
				Each vertex contains an event

	- surveyArea : Polygon:
		generate events (MIDDLE, BEGIN, END) for all vertices.

	- obstacle : Polygon:
		generate events (MIDDLE, IN, OUT) for all vertices.

Primitive Operations:
	Path generation for four-sided convex polygon:
	- Given a pair of begin and end x-coordinates and a series of
	floor and roof edges (gauranteed to be convex for now), generate
	a path that traverses through the polygon completely.
	
	- Path generation is dependent on the height of the drone

Implementation:
	TODO:
		- Limit scan line using "union", unioning with survey area 
		(outer ring) and subtracting obstacles (inner rings).

		- represent polygons in terms of vertices (point_2ds) and
		edges (segment_2ds).

		- Check for intersecting edges of polygons and obstacles with
		the scan line.

		- Generate events, which contain roof and floor edges to construct
		new cells.

		- Avoid duplicates in cell creation (e.g. multiple IN events that
		have the same x-coordinates.)

	Things to think about:
		- Should SurveyArea and Obstacle classes be subclasses of polygon_2d?

	Things to learn:
		- inheritance
		- C++ templates
		- STL containers
